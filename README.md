# Marketing Analysis Project.

This project analyzes marketing data to find customer behavior patterns.

# Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Regex



# Key Insights
- Distribution of **Clicks and Impressions**  ("Understanding user interaction with ads.")
- Language Count by Location 
- How Many Campaigns Made in Each Location
- Calculating **CTR** (measures the percentage of users who saw an ad and clicked on it. A higher CTR indicates a more engaging ad campaign)
- **A/B Testing Analysis** (Performed A/B Testing to compare conversion rates between two groups across different channels using a t-test.")
- **Attribution Model** Analysis
- Deep Dive into **Key Metrics** (Comparing CTR & Conversion Rate across different Channels)
- **Customer Segmentation** Insights 
- Duration's Relation to **Acquisition Cost**




## How to Run Dataset
To run this project, download the dataset used in the analysis from the following link:
[Social Media Advertising Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsonk11/social-media-advertising-dataset)

Make sure to place the CSV file in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path accordingly.

# Engagement vs Conversion Rate Analysis
When analyzing the **average conversion rates across different channels**, Twitter ranks the highest, followed by Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram.

However, the **Engagement Score** analysis shows that Instagram has the highest engagement rate, while Pinterest has one of the lowest engagement rates (with a score of only **1**).

This result highlights that **higher engagement does not always guarantee higher conversions**. While Instagram campaigns may generate more interactions (likes, comments, etc.), Twitter campaigns are more likely to lead to actual conversions, making them more effective in terms of driving customer actions.

This insight suggests that social media campaigns should focus not only on engagement metrics but also on **optimizing content to drive user actions and conversions**.


# Final Insights

After conducting the analysis, I observed the following:

1. The relationship between clicks and impressions indicates a strong correlation, which suggests that higher impressions lead to more clicks.
2. The CTR analysis reveals that some campaigns have much higher engagement rates, which could indicate that the content of those campaigns was more appealing or targeted.
3. The geographical and linguistic analysis shows that some regions have a higher number of campaigns, suggesting that marketing efforts are concentrated in certain areas. This information can be useful for future regional targeting.
4. The acquisition cost analysis demonstrates which companies are investing more in customer acquisition, which can help us identify high-investment companies and their ROI.

These insights will be useful in making data-driven decisions to optimize future campaigns.
